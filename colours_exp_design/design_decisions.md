Decisions about experimental design
==================================

Basic structure of multi-session experiment
--------------------------

i = 0
While i < #sessions:
	1. Discrimination test
	2. Exposure to label-colour pairs
	3. Categorization (category learning with feedback)
	4. Discrimination test - feedback only at the end of the block
	5. i = i+1
	6. Go to 2 (or 3?)


General
-------

- How many colour regions do we use for train+test?
- If more than one, are regions varied within or between blocks? Between sessions? Completely sequential, first one then the other?
- If completely sequential, we could test transfer effects, lack of which have been argued to be a hallmark of low-level perceptual learning (Ahissar & Hochstein, 2004)


Exposure
--------

- Just once during 1st session or before each session as a reminder
- How many trials? A small


Feedback
--------

- Categorization: Trial-by-trial gamified feedback 
- Discrimination: no trial-level feedback to avoid washing away the effects. Only an overall accuracy at the end of the block. Note that Miller et al (2018) do provide feedback on the Discrimination test (p.175: "Pairs of two tactile patterns were presented 400 ms apart in a two-alternative same-different forced choice task with feedback")

- @Maarten: Can feedback be provided as a function of performance in previous sessions?


Color picker
------------

We might want to consider a "colour picker" task at the end of each session (or categorization block?) where participants choose the best example of each of the two categories from a whole region in colour space.


Alternative task for test
--------------------------

Simultaneous colour matching task as in Winawer et al. 2007
