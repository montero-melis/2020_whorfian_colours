Switching from colour to orientation detection
============================================

Challenges
----------

1) Strategies

Participants could use strategies to solve the task: more subtle ones like using external references (e.g., from the room they are in) or less subtle ones like carrying out the task with a ruler or a piece of straight paper that they place on the screen. Another strategy might be to move very close to the screen (see next point). There may be many such strategies to improve performance that by-pass perceptual learning.
--> A way to prevent this is to always give a reference line in the task and instruct participants not to use any other means to help them carry out the task
--> We should also ask participants at the end how they carried out the task and if any "trick" proved to be particularly helpful


2) Location dependency

Low-level perceptual learning is assumed to be location dependent ("psycho-anatomy logic", see Ahissar & Hochstein, 2004, Fig.2). But we will not control the position of a participant's eyes with respect to the screen. So even if we keep the location of the stimulus on the screen constant, its location might randomly vary for  will if participants are trained. In that case we could not assume that low-level perceptual learning can take place.
--> We can ask participants to remain seated in the same position and in the same distance wrt the screen.


3) Line length

Line length also affects acuity in the oblique effect (Orban et al., 1984; cited in Vogels & Orban, 1985, p. 1679). This is expected if the oblique effect comes from low-level properties of the visual system, in particular from simple cells in V1. As there will be variation in the screens used by participants in the online experiment, we cannot control for line length, can we?


4) Simultaneous presentation?

Vogels and Orban (1985) make a case *against* the use of simultaneous presentation of stimuli:
"In the identification task as well as in the 2AFC task, we used a successive rather than a simultaneous presentation of two lines to exclude configurational effects as well as to avoid judgments of parallelness instead of orientation. (An extensive discussion of the problems associated with simultaneous presentation procedures can be found in Matin and Drivas, 1979.)" (p.1680)
Instead they use an identification task (Exp 1) in which participants have to decide in each trial if a stimulus has been tilted  clockwise or anticlockwise from the reference angle (for different deltas).


5) Presentation to one eye only

In many of the studies I've looked at more carefully subjects used one eye only (Vogels et al., 1984; Orban et al.; Vogels & Orban; Mayer, 1983). It is not clear that the same thresholds apply when using both eyes. Note that in Wilks et al (2014) apparently Ss used both eyes.


6) Computation of JNDs

Can Jeroen explain how exactly JNDs are determined:
- In Vogels and Orban (1985, Vis Res)? Formula on p.1681, results p. 1681-2
- In Orban et al (1984, Vis Res), which seems different from the above (using the Stand Dev? not sure how; p.122)


Additions
---------

### Pick best category exemplar

Add a category-exemplar identification task at the end of each training phase: participants are given a category and asked to draw the angle that best matches the category (ideally they can drag something like the hand of a clock with their mouse)


### Task

Judgement of motion (rather than same/different judgements)
